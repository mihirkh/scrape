#  Data scraping using python

This python script uses python's native urllib library, along with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) that makes data parsing convenient. as an example, we parse through the MetroCard swipe data from NYC subway and store them in the adjoining data directory.
